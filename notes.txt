1. Get npm install cosmicjs to start using js

2. Import it in APP

3. In order to get in DATA from cosmicjs, need some info: ID to which project to get data from, then you need API key. Get it from Settings/Basic Settings from cosmis js
You need the bucket slug, read key is the API key, and write key lets you allow write data to the project

4. API keys are supposed to be secret. So we need to save this info in a way that no one else gets access. 
We shall use miljoe variabler. This means that I will put this info in memory and no where else in the code. 

.development.env -- miljoe variabler doc. When you upload crap, docs with .env will be ignored. 

5. stuff from cosmic will be stored in state

look at Basic Usage in npm cosmic documentation

    const client = new Cosmic() INSTEAD OF USING 'require' after you have imported.
